Input the following lines of text, one by one, to create your ECDSA folder directories:

mkdir -p $HOME/keep-ecdsa/config
mkdir -p $HOME/keep-ecdsa/keystore
mkdir -p $HOME/keep-ecdsa/persistence





Input the following line to enter a VIM editor. You will paste the contents of your keep wallet keystore file in here. 
After you have done that, safely save and exit the VIM editor.

nano $HOME/keep-ecdsa/keystore/keep_wallet.json




Input the following lines of text to create environmental variables to use later for your keep random beacon and ecdsa node. 
Fill in the corresponding information in between the quotation marks, do not remove the quotation marks.
Take note to use the single quotations for the keep_client_ethereum_password.
If you have already created these exact variables for another node, skip this step. You can check these variables by typing in env | sort 

export SERVER_IP=$(curl ifconfig.co)
export INFURA_PROJECT_ID=”TU ID DE INFURA”
export ETH_WALLET=”LA CLAVE PUBLICA DE TU METAMASK BILLETERA”
export KEEP_CLIENT_ETHEREUM_PASSWORD=’LA CONTRASEÑA QUE ESCRIBISTE DEL PASO NUMERO 1'





Input the following text block into your VPN node line by line to create your ECDSA config file:
