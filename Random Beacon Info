Input the following lines of text, one by one, to set up firewall rules:

sudo ufw allow 22/tcp
sudo ufw allow 3919/tcp
yes | sudo ufw enable



Input the following lines of text, one by one, to install docker:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io
sudo apt install docker.io curl -y
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker


Input the following line to check if docker is installed:

root@keep-testnet:~# sudo docker --version


Input the following line to install the latest keep-client:

docker pull keepnetwork/keep-client:latest






Input the following lines of text, one by one, to create your Random Beacon folder directories:

mkdir -p $HOME/keep-client/config
mkdir -p $HOME/keep-client/keystore
mkdir -p $HOME/keep-client/persistence





Input the following line to enter a VIM editor. You will paste the contents of your keep wallet keystore file in here. 
After you have done that, safely save and exit the VIM editor.

nano $HOME/keep-client/keystore/keep_wallet.json





Input the following lines of text to create environmental variables to use later for your keep random beacon and ecdsa node. 
Fill in the corresponding information in between the quotation marks, do not remove the quotation marks.
Take note to use the single quotations for the keep_client_ethereum_password.
If you have already created these exact variables for another node, skip this step. You can check these variables by typing in env | sort 

export SERVER_IP=$(curl ifconfig.co)
export INFURA_PROJECT_ID=”TU ID DE INFURA”
export ETH_WALLET=”LA CLAVE PUBLICA DE TU METAMASK BILLETERA”
export KEEP_CLIENT_ETHEREUM_PASSWORD=’LA CONTRASEÑA QUE ESCRIBISTE DEL PASO NUMERO 1'
